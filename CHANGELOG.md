RedNode Studio changelog

New versions go at the top. The release action reads the section matching the
pyproject version and puts it on the GitHub release, so the bold version line
format matters: **version** then a date, notes below until the next bold line.

**1.0.36** - 2026-08-04

Speed and polish, plus the first documentation pass.

- Thumbnails are served resized instead of full size, in the Review strip, the Save grid and the Workspace galleries. Large galleries and big pictures load far lighter
- Save browser: clicking a card no longer flashes blank or jumps the view
- README: nine screenshots, so the panel can be seen before installing
- The example workflow ships as Rednode_Ultima_V1.0.36 Release
- Use as reference: the renderer choice is repaired before the buttons read it, so they cannot briefly look enabled after a renderer is deleted and recreated
- Patch notes now ride every release automatically, which is why this list exists

**1.0.35** - 2026-08-03

Bug fix patch for the Masks redesign and the Paint tab.

- Masks: undo and redo now save the mask, so a queue renders exactly what the canvas shows
- Masks: changing the Paint on picture drops the previous picture's mask instead of carrying it over
- Masks: Open image works now, and a picture of your own survives a reload
- Masks: an auto mask base coat survives a panel rebuild instead of silently vanishing on the next save
- Paint Out: the Never shrink setting now works on external renderer chains, as it already did on Paint Render
- Whole frame: the Mask size dial works in both directions. A 3K picture with the dial at 1024 renders at 1024 and comes back at 1024, so a big frame can be painted at a working size and upscaled after
- Overlay colour and opacity changes repaint open Masks painters immediately
- Rendered by: a chain named Krea2 Workspace shows a warning that the main prompt renders and the paint prompt boxes are ignored
- Use as reference greys out on renderer chains that cannot carry references, with the reason on hover
- The registry's Documentation link no longer points at a folder that does not exist
